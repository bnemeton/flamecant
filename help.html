    <h1>~ ^ ~ FLAMECANT ~ ^ ~</h1>
    <P>A roguelike project to teach Brigid how to make a game in rot.js!</P>
    <p>The title's not in red bc it's 1AM and I'm stoned and forget how to</p>
    <p>do even basic CSS... as this help page probably makes pretty evident,</p>
    <p> I guess.</p>
    <h2>-------------| CONTROLS | --------------</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>movement controls are currently numpad only</li>
            <li>new: you can use qweasdzxc like the numpad for movement!</li>
        <li>think of the 5 button (or S button) as the center of a compass:</li>
        <Li> hit a key to move in the corresponding compass direction</Li>
        <li>(including diagonals!).</li>
        <li>to attack an enemy, move into its tile!</li>
        <li>when using numpad don't forget to turn on numlock!</li>
        <li>p to pick up items in your tile</li>
        <li>i to open inventory</li>
        <li>use the letter index next to the menu item you want to select!</li>
        <li>escape <strong>should</strong> back you out of any menus, but it's possible I missed something.</li>
        <li>cursor/selector and mouse options under consideration!</li>
        <li>on multi-select menus (like picking up multiple items from a tile):</li>
        <li> hit all the indices for desired menu items to change the "-" into a "+" and then hit enter/return to pick them up!</li>
        <li>comma descends downward staircases (">""); period ascends upward ones ("<"</li>
    </ul>
